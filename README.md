* Available triggering modes:
  * `triggerMode: 'LH'` - motion signal is triggered when sensor goes from LOW (0, no-motion) to HIGH (1, motion)
  * `triggerMode: 'H'` - motion signal is triggered whenever the sensor sends a HIGH (1, motion) message

 ⚠ You can disable PIR Sensor detection by using `gpio: 0`

------

#### Motion Configuration

This Feature allows to control your screen with a webcam as a motion detector.

 | Option  | Description | Type | Default |
 | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
 | animate | Animate MMM-Pir module on detect | Boolean | true |
 | captureIntervalTime | Time in ms between capturing images for detection | Number | 1000 |

Notes: `deviceId` value setting:

* Disable Motion: `deviceId: 0,` (You don't have any webcam)
* Enable device auto-detection: `deviceId: 1,`

In 99% of time auto-detection works but in case you have SooOOoo many webcam, open the developer console (`npm start dev`) and try:

`await navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()` to get all devices and copy and past the `deviceId` of your needed device

sample: `deviceId: "27d8c2a4b894149a2caae146d8f4bea9cd74c528453a5859ab18c2c764d7d2411",`

------

#### Cron Configuration

This is the rule to turn your screen on and off based on a set time event

 | Option  | Description | Type | Default |
 | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
 | mode | cron mode (see bellow) | Number | 0 |
 | ON | cron times to turn ON Screen | Array | [] |
 | OFF | cron time to turn OFF Screen | Array | [] |

* Available mode:
  * `mode: 0` - Disable Cron using.
  * `mode: 1` - Wake up / turn OFF automaticaly by CRON and use countdown
    * `MMM-Pir` timer will be used before turn off screen
    * Allow to use sensor/touch/camera when CRON `ON` is activated
    * When screen is OFF by cron, you can't wakeup it.
    * When screen is OFF by timer, you can wakeup it (by sensor, touch, camera)
  * `mode: 2` - Your screen will be fully managed by cron
    * `MMM-Pir` timer will be not displayed and not used
    * You can't use touch mode, pir sensor or camera for wake up or turn off screen
  * `mode: 3` - Wake up / turn OFF automaticaly by CRON and allow wake up
    * `MMM-Pir` timer will be used before turn off screen
    * Allow to use sensor/touch/camera when CRON `ON` is activated
    * When screen is OFF by cron or timer, you can wakeup it (by sensor, touch, camera)

`CRON` event (`ON`/`OFF`) have an object format:

```js
{
  dayOfWeek: <Array of days>,
  hour: <hour>,
  minute: <minute>
}
```

`dayOfWeek` is an array of number
This number define the day:

* `0`: Sunday
* `1`: Monday
* `2`: Tuesday
* `3`: Wednesday
* `4`: Thursday
* `5`: Friday
* `6`: Saturday

##### Sample

sample if you want to create an event from Monday to Thursday at 07h45:

```js
{
  dayOfWeek: [1,2,3,4],
  hour: 7,
  minute: 45
}
```

sample if you want to create an event every Friday at 08h00

```js
{
  dayOfWeek: [5],
  hour: 8,
  minute: 0
}
```

sample if you want to create an event from Monday to Friday at 17h00

```js
{
  dayOfWeek: [1,2,3,4,5],
  hour: 17,
  minute: 0
}
```

##### Create ON/OFF events

Let's create ON and OFF now
I want to apply this rules:

---> Screen is ON:

* from Monday to Thursday at 07h45
* every Friday at 08h00

So, `ON` rules will be:

```js
ON: [
  {
    dayOfWeek: [1,2,3,4],
    hour: 7,
    minute: 45
  },
  {
    dayOfWeek: [5],
    hour: 8,
    minute: 0
  }
],
```

---> Screen is OFF

* from Monday to Friday at 17h00

So, `OFF` rules will be:

```js
OFF: [
  {
    dayOfWeek: [1,2,3,4,5],
    hour: 17,
    minute: 0
  }
]
```

Let's apply your own rules !
Don't be stupid! Don't create an ON event equal to OFF event

------

#### Touch Configuration

 | Option  | Description | Type | Default |
 | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
 | mode | Selected mode for enable/disable the screen with touch (see below) | Number | 3 |

* Available mode:
  * `touchMode: 0`
    * Touch mode is disabled
  * `touchMode: 1`
    * One click on the screen will restart the timer (or Wake up the screen if needed)
    * Double Click on the screen will shutdown the screen
  * `touchMode: 2`
    * One Click on the MMM-Pir area will restart the timer
    * Long Click on the screen will shutdown or wake up the screen (toogle)
  * `touchMode: 3`
    * One Click on the MMM-Pir area will restart the timer
    * Doucle Click on the MMM-Pir area will shutdown the screen
    * One Click on the screen will wake up if shutdown

  * Notes:
    * If you lock your screen with TouchScreen, PIR sensor will be disabled
    * You need to unlock your screen with touchscreen to reactivate the PIR sensor

------

#### Governor Configuration

⚠ **Governor is not available under windows environement**

CPU governor enables the operating system to scale the CPU frequency up or down in order to save power or improve performance.

On each boot of your RPI, your governor is set automaticaly to `ondemand`.

This configuration allows to change it dynamicaly

 | Option  | Description | Type | Default |
 | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
 | sleeping | Governor number mode when your screen is turned off | Number | 4 |
 | working | Governor number mode when your screen is turned on | Number | 2 |

* Available `sleeping` and `working` mode:
  * `0`: Disable any governor mode change
  * `1`: Apply `conservative` governor mode
  * `2`: Apply `ondemand` governor mode
  * `3`: Apply `userspace` governor mode
  * `4`: Apply `powersave` governor mode
  * `5`: Apply `performance` governor mode

If you want a maximum of CPU power, `performance` is the best choice !

If you want an economy mode of CPU power, `powersave` is the best choice !

------

#### Sounds Configuration

Sounds configuration will play audio file when your screen turn on or off.

 | Option  | Description | Type | Default |
 | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
 | on | File to play when screen turn on | String or 0 | open.mp3 |
 | off | File to play when screen turn off | String or 0 | close.mp3 |

You can personalize your sound, just past your file into `sounds` folder and report filename (with extension) in your configuration

You can disable sound by using `0` in your configuration

------

## Developer Notes

* This module broadcasts:

  * `MMM_PIR-SCREEN_POWERSTATUS` with payload `true` when your screen turn on.
  * `MMM_PIR-SCREEN_POWERSTATUS` with payload `false` when your screen turn off.
  * `MMM_PIR-USER_PRESENCE` with payload `true` when motion is detected.

* This module receive:

  * `MMM_PIR-END` notification to force the end of the count down.
  * `MMM_PIR-WAKEUP` notification to wake up the screen and reset count down.
  * `MMM_PIR-LOCK` notification keep the screen on and lock it (freeze counter and stop pir detection).
  * `MMM_PIR-UNLOCK` notification unlock the screen and restart counter and pir detection.
